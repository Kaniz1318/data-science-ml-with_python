        "## Summary: How We Used All Four Principles\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔒 **Encapsulation**\n",
        "- **Private attributes**: `_person_id`, `_email`, `_grades`, `_salary`\n",
        "- **Controlled access**: Methods like `get_contact_info()`, `get_transcript()`\n",
        "- **Data protection**: Grades can only be modified through proper methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧬 **Inheritance**\n",
        "- **Base class**: `Person` with common attributes (name, age, ID)\n",
        "- **Child classes**: `Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `Person`\n",
        "- **Code reuse**: Both students and teachers get contact info and introduction methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎭 **Polymorphism**\n",
        "- **Same method name**: `get_role()` and `introduce()` work differently for students vs teachers\n",
        "- **Flexible code**: `list_all_people()` works with any type of person\n",
        "- **Easy extension**: We could add `Principal` or `Janitor` classes easily\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎨 **Abstraction**\n",
        "- **Simple interfaces**: `give_grade()`, `add_person()`, `get_transcript()`\n",
        "- **Hidden complexity**: GPA calculation, email generation happen automatically\n",
        "- **User-friendly**: Users don't need to know internal implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation** keeps related data and methods together and safe\n",
        "2. **Inheritance** helps you build on existing code without starting from scratch\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism** makes your code flexible and easy to extend\n",
        "4. **Abstraction** hides complexity and provides simple interfaces\n",
        "\n",
        "These principles work together to make code that is:\n",
        "- **Organized** (easier to understand)\n",
        "- **Reusable** (don't repeat yourself)\n",
        "- **Maintainable** (easier to fix and improve)\n",
        "- **Extensible** (easier to add new features)"

        "Design an online store with:\n",
        "- A `Product` class with price, name, and stock\n",
        "- Different product types: `Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Books`\n",
        "- A `ShoppingCart` class that can hold different product types\n",
        "- Demonstrate polymorphism with a `calculate_shipping()` method\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge: Animal Shelter\n",
        "Build an animal shelter management system:\n",
        "- Base `Animal` class\n",
        "- Different animal types with unique behaviors\n",
